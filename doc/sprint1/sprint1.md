# Sprint 1 Report - RideEase Project

## Sprint Overview
- **Sprint Duration**: Nov 7, 2024 - Nov 20, 2024
- **Sprint Goal**: Complete front-end development for splash screens, implement swiping functionality, and set up sign-in/sign-up screens.

## Team Members
- **Hassan**, **Ahmad**, **Ryan**, **Allen**, **Abdulbasit**
- Some members were unavailable for specific stand-ups due to exams and other commitments.

## Completed Work
- Implemented splash screens based on Figma designs.
- Developed swipe functionality for navigation.
- Set up sign-in/sign-up screens with required fields (email, password, etc.).

## Ongoing Work
- API endpoints not yet built (planned for next sprint).
- Some UI refinements pending.
- Database implementation is still not complete

## Challenges & Blockers
- Blocker: Delay in front-end development due to unclear Figma design elements.
- Workaround: Team held extra review sessions with the design lead to finalize design clarity.

## Retrospective
### What Went Well:
- Good collaboration on front-end development despite conflicting schedules.
- Managed to complete sign-in/sign-up screens successfully.

### What Could Be Improved:
- Better coordination on design clarification earlier in the sprint.
- More consistent attendance at stand-ups to maintain momentum.

### Lessons Learned:
- Early clarification with design team can prevent delays.

## Plans for Next Sprint
- **Goal**: Begin backend API development, integrate sign-in functionality with backend, complete database, and refine UI elements.
- **Tasks to Focus On**: Start building API endpoints for user authentication and data management.

## Additional Notes
- Waiting on TA feedback from the demo scheduled for tomorrow.
