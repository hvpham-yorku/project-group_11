# RideEase System Design Document

## **High-Level Class Description using CRC Cards**
### Class: `RideRequest`
- **Parent Class (if any):** None
- **Subclasses (if any):** ScheduledRideRequest, InstantRideRequest
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Create ride requests with location, time, and passenger details.
  - Validate ride request parameters.
  - Track request status (pending, accepted, completed).
- **Collaborators:**
  - RideMatcher
  - UserProfile
  
### Class: `UserProfile`
- **Parent Class (if any):** None
- **Subclasses (if any):** DriverProfile, PassengerProfile
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Store user information (e.g., name, contact, payment details).
  - Manage user preferences.
  - Track ride history.
- **Collaborators:**
  - RideRequest
  - PaymentProcessor

### Class: `RideMatcher`
- **Parent Class (if any):** None
- **Subclasses (if any):** None
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Match passengers with drivers based on location and preferences.
  - Optimize matches using algorithms (e.g., shortest route, lowest cost).
  - Handle re-matching in case of driver cancellation.
- **Collaborators:**
  - RideRequest
  - UserProfile

### Class: `PaymentProcessor`
- **Parent Class (if any):** None
- **Subclasses (if any):** None
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Handle fare calculations.
  - Process payments via credit card or digital wallets.
  - Manage refunds and dispute resolutions.
- **Collaborators:**
  - UserProfile
  - RideRequest

### Class: `NotificationSystem`
- **Parent Class (if any):** None
- **Subclasses (if any):** None
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Send notifications to users about ride status.
  - Notify drivers of incoming ride requests.
  - Handle alerts for cancellations or system issues.
- **Collaborators:**
  - RideRequest
  - UserProfile

## **System Interaction with the Environment**
The RideEase application relies on the following dependencies and assumptions for operation:

- **Operating System:** The system will primarily operate on Android and iOS mobile platforms. It also requires backend servers running Linux.
- **Programming Languages and Frameworks:**
  - Frontend: React Native for cross-platform compatibility.
  - Backend: Python (Django/Flask) or Node.js.
- **Database:** A relational database such as PostgreSQL to store user profiles, ride requests, and transaction details.
- **Network Configuration:** The system requires stable internet connectivity to communicate with cloud services and APIs.
- **Third-party APIs:**
  - Google Maps API for location and routing services.
  - Stripe API for payment processing.
- **Error Handling Assumptions:**
  - Valid user input is expected; invalid input will prompt error messages.
  - System will retry failed network requests up to 3 times before notifying the user.

## **System Architecture**

The system uses a three-tier architecture:
1. **Presentation Layer:**
   - Composed of the mobile application interface.
   - Includes user registration, ride request creation, and payment options.

2. **Business Logic Layer:**
   - Contains core functionalities such as ride matching, payment processing, and notification management.
   - Handles algorithms for driver-passenger pairing and route optimization.

3. **Data Layer:**
   - Manages the database with tables for user profiles, ride requests, and transaction logs.
   - Ensures data consistency and secure storage.

### Architectural Diagram:
- [Frontend] --[HTTPS]--> [Backend API Server] --[SQL Queries]--> [Database]
- Backend also integrates with third-party services like Google Maps and Stripe.

## **Error and Exception Handling Strategy**

### Anticipated Errors:
1. **Invalid User Input:**
   - Strategy: Input validation on the frontend and backend to prevent invalid requests.
   - Response: Display user-friendly error messages and suggestions for corrections.

2. **Network Failures:**
   - Strategy: Implement retries with exponential backoff for API calls.
   - Response: Notify users of connectivity issues and save actions locally for retry.

3. **External System Failures (e.g., API downtime):**
   - Strategy: Monitor API health using heartbeat checks.
   - Response: Provide fallback mechanisms or alternative options (e.g., cached map data).

4. **Driver/Passenger Cancellations:**
   - Strategy: Update ride status in real-time and initiate re-matching procedures.
   - Response: Notify affected parties and adjust fare calculations if applicable.

5. **Payment Processing Issues:**
   - Strategy: Validate payment methods and transaction details before processing.
   - Response: Retry failed transactions and notify users of success or failure.
