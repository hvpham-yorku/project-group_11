Meeting took place on discord on November 26th, 2024 at 6:30pm. All members were present.

### Task

The goal of sprint 1 was to have a running front-end of the app using React-Native which can be tested on both on the web and on a mobile device. 

### Tasks Completed
In summary, the goal of sprint 1 was to implement the following features:
1. Create a "Get Started" page with an engaging, user-friendly design that welcomes users, similar to the intuitive onboarding experiences found in modern apps.
2. Create a Sign Up page for the User. (Combination of User Study 1 and 2)
3. Have a verification code sent on the User's email they provided to authenticate the user.
4. Create a Sign In page for the User.
5. Create a Home page where the user is directed to once they have signed in with their RideEase account. (User Study 3)
6. Have tabs where we can shift through pages (including a profile page) (User Study 17)
   
### Tasks to work on in Sprint 2
The above features were successfully implemented with sprint 1, therefore in our planning we moved on to adding the following user stories for sprint 2. Since in sprint 1, we wanted to test out the functionalities, we will later update the user stories 1 & 2 in sprint 2.

1. As a passenger, I want to create an account and provide my information so that I can use the app’s services.  (Needs to be updated in Sprint 2)
2. As a driver, I want to create an account and provide my necessary documents so that I can use the app’s services to find passengers. (Needs to be updated in Sprint 2)
3. As a passenger, I want to set a destination and view the estimated fare so that I know the cost of my ride before booking.
4. As a driver, I want to view incoming ride requests with passenger information so that I can choose to accept or decline.
5. As a passenger, I want to see the driver's estimated time of arrival once the ride is booked so that I can prepare for pickup.
6. As a passenger, I want to be able to track the driver’s location live so that I know the progress of my ride.
7. As a driver, I want to be able to navigate to the pickup location with the GPS provided in-app for ease of access.
8. As an admin, I want to be able to view a dashboard showing all active rides so that I can monitor platform activity.
9. As a passenger, I want the option to rate my driver after the ride is complete so that I can share feedback.
10. As a driver, I want to be able to review my payments for each ride so that I can track my earnings.
11. As a driver, I want a confirmation of payment after each completed ride to ensure I receive accurate compensation.
12. As an admin, I want to be able to review any complaints or feedback from users to ensure quality service.
13. As a passenger, I want to receive notifications if my driver is delayed so that I can adjust my plans.
14. As a driver, I want to see an option to log out of the app so that I can securely end my session.
15. As a passenger, I want to be able to edit my profile information (such as address or payment details) so that my information remains accurate.
16. As an admin, I want to have a way to view user documents for background checks, ensuring user verification.
17. As a driver, I want to set my availability status (online/offline) so that I only receive ride requests when I’m available.
  

### Group Practices

**What are practices that you should continue during next sprint**
The practices that we would continue in our sprint would be to have regular team meetings to ensure clear communication, align on goals, and address any roadblocks. We will also continue with daily stand-ups to maintain focus, discuss progress, and identify challenges early.

**What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint**
Some new practices we would want to use is incase our app's functionalities do not work the way we expect it to work, instead of spending too much on it we should work on the other parts of the sprint.

**What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint**
Given the time constraint, one of the practices we should stop using is to put too much time miniscule features that would not benefit the user that much.

**What was your best/worst experience during sprint 1**
**Best experience:** Having our frontend working with a beautiful design that would be appealing to the user and had some of our goals accomplished (Getting Started, Sign In/Sign Up, and Home Page).
**Worst experience:** Have the remaining user studies pending which adds up our work for sprint 2.
