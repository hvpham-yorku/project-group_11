## Overview
What "done" means for our team is when all of our team members have 100% **completed** the tasks that were assigned as well as fulfill the requirements that are provided. 
## Standard Definition of Done
This team has agreed that a feature is considered "done" when:

1. **Code is completed**:
   - Atleast one member from the team has reviewed the code after being typed and pushed to github.
   - The code follows the Agile model software process
  
2. **Bug Fixing**:
   - All known bugs identified during testing have been resolved which should not generate any compilation or logical error.
     
3. **Unit Testing**:
   - Unit tests have been written and cover essential functionality.
   - All unit tests pass successfully without any errors or failures. 

4. **Integration and System Testing**:
   - The feature has been tested in the development environment.
   - Integration tests confirm that the feature works as expected within the broader system.

5. **Feature Demo**:
   - The feature has been demonstrated to the team and approved for functionality.
     
6. **Documentation**:
   - Code is documented to explain logic where necessary.
   - User-facing documentation (if applicable) has been updated (e.g., README, user guides).
   


## Additional Definition
For additional features that are complex, the following may be applied:

1. **Performance Testing**:
   - Testing for performance has been completed to make sure the feature satisfies acceptable requirements without causing sustem regressions.

2. **Security Review**:
   - A simple security review has been completed so that there is no risk of security breaches.

3. **Compliance with Design by Contract**:
   - Any feature with preconditions, postconditions, or invariants is properly validated according to the "Design by Contract" approach

4. **Approval from TAs or Instructors**:
   - The feature of the project has been reviewed and approved by the instructor or the teaching assistants during the phases.

## Agreement
This team (group 11) has agreed to this definition of "done" by all team members to not only maintain consistency, but also the quality across all user stories.
