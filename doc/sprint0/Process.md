## Team Reflections and Organization

In the initial phase of the RideEase project, our team maintained consistent communication and collaboration to meet our goals. We organized the team by dividing key responsibilities across members according to our skills, with each person contributing to various user stories and project components as needed. We primarily used Trello for tracking tasks and progress, Discord for discussions and collaborative sessions, and WhatsApp for quick updates and ongoing communication.

## Decision-Making Process

Our decision-making approach combined majority and consensus, depending on the specific decision. This flexibility allowed us to adapt based on the nature of each decision, enabling faster resolutions without the need for a rigid voting structure. This approach worked well and helped keep discussions productive, allowing us to reach decisions without unnecessary delays.

## Priority Setting and Points Estimation

For prioritizing user stories, we focused on the main functionality of the app, identifying key features essential for a smooth user experience (e.g., account creation, ride requests, GPS tracking). When estimating points, we used 1-2 rounds of voting per story, relying on consensus for easier-to-evaluate stories and discussions when there was initial disagreement. This kept the process efficient, with minimal need for additional voting rounds.

## Meeting Frequency

While we met in person a few times, we relied heavily on continuous communication through WhatsApp to stay updated. This setup allowed us to work flexibly while staying informed on each other’s progress. Additional in-person meetings could further enhance our coordination, particularly for complex issues or larger decisions.

## Lessons Learned for the Next Phase

### What Worked Well

- **Efficient Decision-Making**: By using a mix of majority and consensus-based decisions, we were able to adapt our process depending on the complexity of the decision. This flexibility minimized bottlenecks, allowing us to make decisions quickly while ensuring that everyone felt heard and included.

- **Communication on WhatsApp**: Our constant communication channel kept everyone updated in real time, helping resolve questions and provide feedback promptly. This responsiveness fostered a collaborative environment where everyone felt connected to the project’s daily progress.

- **Adaptability and Ownership**: Each team member demonstrated a high level of adaptability, stepping into roles or tasks as needed, which helped us keep up with our timeline. The collective sense of ownership contributed positively to both morale and productivity, with each person actively engaging in discussions and problem-solving.


### Areas for Improvement

- **Clearer Task Assignments**: While everyone was engaged and flexible, we would benefit from more clearly defined task assignments, especially as we progress into phases with more interdependent components. Establishing individual responsibilities for specific user stories or features would reduce overlap and make it easier to track accountability.

- **Regular Checkpoints**: Adding structured checkpoints at key stages would provide opportunities for deeper alignment. For example, setting a standard for sprint review meetings or mid-sprint check-ins could improve synchronization on tasks, giving us a chance to recalibrate if needed and keep everyone updated on progress.

- **Documentation of Decisions/Changes**: Although our informal discussions were effective, keeping a formal record of decisions—such as feature adjustments, priority changes, and assigned tasks—in a shared location (e.g., Trello or a shared document) could help the team stay organized and provide clarity for everyone on the project’s evolving requirements.

- **Planning with Trello**: Using Trello more for task management will give us a visual overview of the project status. This initial structure will be crucial for tracking progress and setting clear goals for each sprint, providing transparency and accountability.


With these improvements, we can ensure that each team member remains aligned and fully supported, which will ultimately strengthen our progress in the next phase.
