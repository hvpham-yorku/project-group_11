## Project Name: **RideEase**

---

### Project Objective
RideEase is a ride-hailing platform designed to connect passengers with nearby drivers, providing reliable, secure, and convenient transportation options. RideEase has a three-tier architecture to ensure that the application will be able to scale and be reliable, user-friendly, for a seamless experience while the platform evolves.

### Key Users
1. **Riders**: These are people who need to get fast, affordable, and convenient rides without concern for driving or parking.
2. **Drivers**: These are contractors seeking flexible income opportunities who would want to connect to passengers with ease.
3. **Admins**: These will be team members in charge of overseeing the operations of an application for quality and support to users.

### Key Use Cases
- **Requesting a Ride**: Riders fill in the destination, see the approximate cost, and request the ride. The app connects them to the nearest driver who may accept it or decline.
**Real-time GPS Tracking**: Enable riders and drivers to track each other while on the ride for accurate pickups and more precise arrival time estimates.
**Secure Payment**: Riders complete their payments through the app after the ride. It will support various payment options and be more transparent in fare calculation.

### Key Usage Scenarios
1. **Rider Use Case**: The rider opens the application, inserts their destination, requests the ride, tracks their driver's arrival, and pays at the end of the journey.
2. **Driver Use Case**: A driver logs in to the application, receives and accepts requests for a ride, uses GPS to navigate to the rider, performs the ride, and gets paid.
3. **Admin Use Case**: Admins use the dashboard to view active rides, respond to customers' support queries, and monitor platform performance.

### Key Design Principles
- **User-Centric Design**: Prioritize convenience for a rider and driver by eliminating unnecessary steps to complete their tasks.
- **Reliability and Scalability**: Guarantee efficiency under higher loads.
- **Security and Privacy**: Ensure security of user data is key, especially related to payment and location tracking.
