## Project Name: **RideEase**

---

1. ### Project Objective
RideEase is a platform that will be potentially used by passengers who want a ride to a certain place and by drivers who are willing to provide the service of transportation. This platform will be used to connect these primary users for a transaction of the service. RideEase will use a three-tier architecture to ensure that the application will scale well and be reliable as well as user-friendly so that it may have many users using this platform.

2. ### Key Users
1. **Riders**: People who want a ride from one place to another in an affordable, secure, reliable way. These users may either not own a vehicle, not have a license, be on a budget, or who care about the environment and would prefer carpooling, etc., or may use it for any other reason.
2. **Drivers**: These are people who would like to connect with the other end users (passengers) to provide their driving service safely and securely, in addition to seeking flexible income opportunities.
3. **Admins**: These will be team members in charge of overseeing the operations of an application for quality and support to users.

3. ### Key Use Cases
1. **Background Check**: Upon users signing up (whether it's the passenger or the driver), they will be required to provide a security clearance document to ensure the safety of both the drivers and passengers.
2. **Passenger signs up**: Upon passenger signing up, they will be asked for their phone number, address, email, credit card information, and security clearance. After all the documents are uploaded, the user receives a "Thank you for joining RideEase message" and will be given a tutorial to use the app.
3. **Driver signs up**: Upon drivers signing up, they will be asked for their driver's license, document for eligibility to work, car insurance documents, social insurance number, and bank details to receive their payment. After all the documents are uploaded, the user receives a "Thank you for joining RideEase message" and will be given a tutorial to use the app.
4. **Request for ride**: The passenger sets their destination, sees the estimated fare, and requests a ride. The passenger gets connected via the app with the nearest driver, who can accept or decline the ride after seeing who the potential passenger may be and the destination provided.
5. **Live GPS Tracking**: Enable drivers and passengers to track each other's location on the way so that arrival time estimates would be more accurate, with pickups just right.
6. **Payment**: Drivers use the app after a ride to complete the payments securely (Passenger pays). It shall be more transparent in fare calculation and provide multiple options for payment.

4. ### Key Usage Scenarios
1. **Passenger Use Case**: The passenger opens the application, signs up as a passenger, inputs their destination, requests the ride, tracks their driver's arrival, and does a pre-authorized payment at the start of the ride.
2. **Driver Use Case**: A driver logs in to the application, signs up as a driver, receives the ride, checks the name of the passenger who booked the ride, sees number of other passengers, sees the destination provided, accepts requests for a ride, uses GPS to navigate to the rider, performs the ride, and gets the full payment at the end of the ride.
3. **Admin Use Case**: Admins use the dashboard to view active rides, respond to customers' support queries, and monitor platform performance.

### Key Design Principles
- **User-Centric Design**: Prioritize convenience for a rider and driver by eliminating unnecessary steps to complete their tasks.
- **Reliability and Scalability**: Guarantee efficiency under higher loads.
- **Security and Privacy**: Ensure security of user data is key, especially related to payment and location tracking.
